            <h1>What</h1>
            <p>REI recently launched <a href="https://our.rei.com">a union busting website</a> in lieu of the <a href="https://www.laborpress.org/reis-customer-base-shows-support-for-pro-union-employees-at-soho-store/">New York Soho store call for a union vote</a>.</p>
            <p>Many co-op members have been led to believe that REI is a company that values ethics, the environment, and benefits of being outdoors.</p>
            <p>This is a project to drum up support not only for the union vote, but to aggregate REI members and use our votes to oust the shit board that created this mess.</p>
            <p>REI is not and never was a worker-owned cooperative, but a consumer co-op. Voting rights are dictated by a membership, purchased for $20, and actively maintained by at least $10/year of purchases. Since we members get a vote, maybe we can take back a tiny chunk of democracy in this one slice of outdoor retail.</p>

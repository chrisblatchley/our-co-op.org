# Our Co-op
REI recently launched a union busting website in lieu of the [Soho store call for a union vote](https://www.laborpress.org/reis-customer-base-shows-support-for-pro-union-employees-at-soho-store/).

Well I think that's complete bullshit, especially from a company that ostensibly values ethics, the environment, and benefits of being outdoors.

This is a project to drum up support not only for the union vote, but to aggregate REI members and use our votes to oust the shit board that created this mess, and take back the co-op from the corporate execs.

# Not a Co-op
REI is not and never was a worker-owned cooperative, but a consumer co-op. Voting rights are dictated by a membership, purchased for $20, and actively maintained by at least $10/year of purchases. Since we members get a vote, maybe we can take back a tiny chunk of democracy in this one slice of outdoor retail.
